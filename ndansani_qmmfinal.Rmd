## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
The three factors: 
GPA - shows how devoted someone is in a course as well as being a good benchmark and indicator of their learning abilities.
Their technical skills indicate how good they are at a the particular course subject being addressed.
The course interaction shows how much the person interacts in the class which can show how interested and devoted they are to the subject matter. 
  The technical section has a ranking of 
  low interaction = 1
  moderate interaction = 2
  high interaction = 3
  GPA - 20%
  Tecnhical - 40%
  Course Interaction - 40%

Decision variables are the group assignments for each student =  x_ij

Decision variables:
x_ij = 1 if the student is in a group else(student is not in a group) = 0

Objective function :
Maximize sum_{i=1}^{12} sum_{j=1}^{4} x_ij * success_score_i

Constraints:

Each group, j, the sum of the group of students has to equal 3
sum_{i=1}^{12} x_{ij} = 3

Each student, i, the  sum of each assignment has to equal 
sum_{j=1}^{4} x_{ij} = 1

With this formualation, the problem can be solved using an lp model. 


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r }
getwd()
stdata <- read.csv ("student_groups.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

```
```{r }

library(lpSolveAPI)

QMM <- read.lp("student.lp")

solve(QMM)

get.objective(QMM) # calculating objective function

get.variables(QMM) # Calculating the decision variables


group=c(2,2,3,1,2,1,3,4,1,3,4,4)

final_group=cbind(stdata,group)
final_group
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
